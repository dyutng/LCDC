## Overview
The Lapeer County Drain Commission Office is a local government office in rural Michigan. Currently, they rely on maps that are not easily updated or interactive. This project aims to modernize the mapping tools for the office to improve efficiency in data handling and map presentation.

## Goals
- Enable data entry via copy-paste functionality that generates a map.
- Allow curves and dynamic elements to be displayed on the map.
- Provide a feature for easy printing and saving of generated maps.

## Specifications
The redesigned system will focus on the following:
- An intuitive, easy-to-navigate layout with a potential centralized volunteer sign-up form.
- Functionality for board members to make updates without requiring technical skills.
- Compatibility with mobile devices for easy access.
- Dedicated sections for each of DPâ€™s eight community partners, showcasing their missions, events, and volunteer opportunities.
- Sustainability-focused design to keep ongoing maintenance costs low and ensure a long-term impact.
